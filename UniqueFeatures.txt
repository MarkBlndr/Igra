Game Description:
	Use the arrow keys to collect as many disks as possible in the alloted time frame. Use the arrow keys to move the robot, touch the disk to collect. Number of disks colleceted will be displayed when time runs out.

New Features Implemented: 
	- Implemented psuedo-random disk spawn locations withing the bounds of the game window.
	- Imaplemtned basic disk spinning animation.
	- Implemented "walls" at the edges of the game window. Player character is unable to run off of the screen.
	- Implemented time based on framerate (not ideal, of course).
	- Adjusted vdata[] initilization in OpenGLRenderer:Draw(), now image drawn to the screen is the size of the individual sprite texture size as opposed to drawing an image the size of the full sprite sheet, and blowing up the texture to fill the image.
	- Added texture size variables to Unit class for more accutrate better collision calculations. Collisions now account for sprites, where the texture of the sprite is smaller than the size of the entire sprite sheet image. 

Known issues and idiosyncrasies:
	- Sprite sheets must be the height of the individual sprite texture (essentially long strips). This is due to the way I initialize the vdata array. A few adjustments, with smarter coordinate calculations could fix this.
	- Disks can sometimes spawn on the robot, giving the player a "free" point. This is not necesseraly an issue, since the game already has a large luck element. But, this could be adjusted with some additional disk spawn logic.
